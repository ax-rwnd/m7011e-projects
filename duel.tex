\begin{refsection}
According to Bartle's Taxonomy\supercite{bartle}, there are four types of players: Hearts (socializers), clubs (slayers), diamonds (achievers) and spades (explorers). If one were to implement a game for encouraging students to study more it would take some clever design to actually reach all types. Instead, design a slayer-targeting game wherein multiple players fight it out by using code.

The language of the code and the format of the competition is left to you to decide, but it should obviously 

Implement a multiplayer game for 2-8 players that is based on coding wherein the players duel.
