\task{Semi-Anonymous Questions}
To learn from courses, it is important to participate and understand the discussed subjects. A common problem is student-student peer pressure, that is, students don't dare ask questions that may be percieved as `stupid'. Of course, most questions that students may have are not stupid and more importantly not limited to that student. Instead, it is often a result of the lecturer being vague, incorrect or omitting content.

Your task is to design a service for passing semi-anonymous questions to the lecturer. That means that the students should not be aware of who owns which question, while the lecturer should. Furthermore, it should be light-weight enough that an end-user can start using it with minimal previous knowledge of the system in no more than 5 minutes.

\subsection*{Requirements}
Apart from the general requirements, you must at least implement:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Centralized authentication
	\item Lecturer front-end
	\item Student front-end
	\item A scalable back-end
\end{itemize}
If you've got the time, after finishing the general requirements, you may want to continue with:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Gamifying the desing
	\item Collecting and aggregating anonymous statistics
	\item Implementing multiple authentication backends (CAS/LDAP/OAUTH/OpenID)
\end{itemize}
